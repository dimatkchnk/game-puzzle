# game-puzzle
A simple, small puzzle game. (with polish comments)

How it works:
On start of program given a character ('#', 'H', '$', '%', '@', '?', 'V', '0', '1', '2', '3', '6'), rotation (Case 0: 0, 360 stopni, Case 1: 90, Case 2: 180, Case 3: 270), coordinates (x, y), then, if all data is correct, the program is adding puzzle on a board.
The main idea is to fill board with puzzles.
